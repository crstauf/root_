# Code Design

Code design is a critical aspect of development within a team. The primary objective of code design is to establish standards that allow any developer (of any experience level) on the team to quickly read and understand the code and its structure.

In [_What Makes Readable Code: Not What You Think_](https://simpleprogrammer.com/what-makes-code-readable-not-what-you-think/) ([Pocket](https://app.getpocket.com/read/364235794)), [John Somnez](https://twitter.com/simpleprogrammr) describes the difference between how experienced developers and beginner developers read code.

> An experienced developer is more focused on the actual concept being expressed by the codeâ€”what the purpose of the code is, not how it is doing it.

> A beginner is more focused on the actual vocabulary of the language than what the expression of that language is trying to convey.

Consider this example of children learning to read:

> When young kids are reading books for the first time, they start out by sounding out each word. When they are reading, they are not focusing on the grammar or the thought being conveyed by the writing, so much as they are focusing on the very structure of the words themselves.

As mentioned previously, our code design standards are intended to make the code quickly readable by any developer on the team. To that end, the code design standards attempt to strike a balance between vocabulary that is easy to understand, but structured in a way for experienced developers to quickly consume.
